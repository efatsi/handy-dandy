# Handy Dandy

Useful VSCode functions for my local dev environment.

# To re-install locally:

Need to have vsce installed: `npm install -g vsce`
```bash
vsce package
```

Then:
- Open VS Code
- Go to the Extensions view `(Cmd+Shift+X)`
- Click the `...` menu at the top-right and choose `Install from VSIX...`
- Locate the .vsix file and select it

# Thanks to...
